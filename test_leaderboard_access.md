# Leaderboard Access Fix Test Guide

## ‚úÖ **Permissions Fixed**

### **Problem Identified:**

- Views were not accessible from the frontend due to missing permissions
- `anon` role didn't exist in the database
- Views needed `PUBLIC` access for frontend to read them

### **Solution Applied:**

1. **Granted PUBLIC permissions** to both views:

   - `player_stats`
   - `simple_player_stats`

2. **Granted PUBLIC permissions** to underlying tables:

   - `users`
   - `tournaments`
   - `tournament_participants`
   - `matches`
   - `round_robin_matches`

3. **Enhanced error logging** in the leaderboard page for better debugging

## **Testing Steps:**

### **1. Database Verification** ‚úÖ

- [x] Views are accessible from database
- [x] Sample data exists (4 players with statistics)
- [x] Permissions are properly set

### **2. Frontend Testing**

- [ ] Navigate to `/leaderboard`
- [ ] Check browser console for connection test logs
- [ ] Verify real data is displayed (not demo data)
- [ ] Check for any remaining error messages

### **3. Expected Console Logs:**

```
Testing Supabase connection...
Supabase connection test successful: [...]
Attempting to fetch from player_stats view...
Successfully fetched from player_stats view
```

### **4. Expected Leaderboard Data:**

- **Player Three**: 1 tournament won (Champion)
- **Player One**: 100% win rate (6/6 matches)
- **Player Two**: 0% win rate (0/6 matches)
- **unknown**: No matches played

## **If Issues Persist:**

### **Check Browser Console:**

- Look for "Supabase connection test failed" messages
- Check for detailed error information
- Verify which data source is being used

### **Database Connection:**

- Ensure `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set
- Check if Supabase client is properly configured
- Verify network connectivity

### **Fallback Testing:**

- The page should try `player_stats` view first
- If that fails, it should try `simple_player_stats` view
- If both fail, it should use manual calculation
- If all fail, it should show demo data

## **Success Indicators:**

- ‚úÖ No error messages in console
- ‚úÖ Real player data displayed
- ‚úÖ Tournament winners shown correctly
- ‚úÖ Win percentages calculated accurately
- ‚úÖ Search and sort functionality working

The leaderboard should now work properly with real tournament data! üèÜ
