3. **Select "prizes" table**
4. **Find the prize you want to delete**
5. **Click the delete button (trash icon)**

If delete still doesn't work after running the fix:

1. **Check your admin role** - Make sure you're actually an admin
2. **Try a different browser** - Clear cache and cookies
3. **Check Supabase logs** - Look for any error messages
4. **Contact support** - Share the specific error message

**The fix script should resolve most delete issues! üõ†Ô∏è**
