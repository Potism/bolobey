## 🔍 **Monitoring Tools & Setup**

### **📊 Built-in Analytics (Supabase):**

```sql
-- User engagement tracking
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_views,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users,
  AVG(session_duration) as avg_session_time
FROM prize_page_views
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Redemption analytics
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_redemptions,
  SUM(points_spent) as total_points_spent,
  AVG(points_spent) as avg_redemption_value
FROM prize_redemptions
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Popular prizes
SELECT
  p.name,
  COUNT(*) as redemption_count,
  SUM(pr.points_spent) as total_points
FROM prize_redemptions pr
JOIN prizes p ON pr.prize_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.id, p.name
ORDER BY redemption_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### **📈 Google Analytics Setup:**

```javascript
// Track prize catalog views
gtag("event", "view_item_list", {
  item_list_id: "prizes_catalog",
  item_list_name: "Prizes Catalog",
});

// Track wishlist additions
gtag("event", "add_to_wishlist", {
  currency: "points",
  value: prize.points_cost,
  items: [
    {
      item_id: prize.id,
      item_name: prize.name,
      item_category: prize.category,
    },
  ],
});

// Track redemptions
gtag("event", "purchase", {
  transaction_id: redemption.id,
  value: redemption.points_spent,
  currency: "points",
  items: [
    {
      item_id: prize.id,
      item_name: prize.name,
      item_category: prize.category,
    },
  ],
});
```

### **🔔 Real-time Monitoring:**

```sql
-- Monitor active users
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users,
  COUNT(*) as total_actions
FROM user_activity_log
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- Monitor system health
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_prizes,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN stock_quantity = 0 THEN 1 END) as out_of_stock,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN stock_quantity <= 5 THEN 1 END) as low_stock
FROM prizes
WHERE is_active = true;
```

## 🚨 **Alert System Setup**

### **📊 Performance Alerts:**

```sql
-- Low stock alerts
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_low_stock()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.stock_quantity <= 5 AND OLD.stock_quantity > 5 THEN
    -- Send notification to admins
    INSERT INTO admin_alerts (type, message, data)
    VALUES ('low_stock', 'Prize running low on stock',
            jsonb_build_object('prize_id', NEW.id, 'stock', NEW.stock_quantity));
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- High demand alerts
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_high_demand()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM prize_redemptions
      WHERE prize_id = NEW.prize_id
      AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour') > 10 THEN
    -- Send high demand alert
    INSERT INTO admin_alerts (type, message, data)
    VALUES ('high_demand', 'Prize experiencing high demand',
            jsonb_build_object('prize_id', NEW.prize_id));
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### **🔔 User Experience Alerts:**

```sql
-- Error rate monitoring
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_errors,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN error_type = 'redemption_failed' THEN 1 END) as redemption_errors,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN error_type = 'insufficient_points' THEN 1 END) as points_errors
FROM error_logs
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

## 📈 **Optimization Strategies**

### **🎯 Prize Catalog Optimization:**

```sql
-- Analyze category performance
SELECT
  category,
  COUNT(*) as total_prizes,
  AVG(redemption_count) as avg_redemptions,
  SUM(total_points) as total_revenue
FROM (
  SELECT
    p.category,
    p.id,
    COUNT(pr.id) as redemption_count,
    SUM(pr.points_spent) as total_points
  FROM prizes p
  LEFT JOIN prize_redemptions pr ON p.id = pr.prize_id
  GROUP BY p.id, p.category
) sub
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### **💰 Pricing Optimization:**

```sql
-- Price sensitivity analysis
SELECT
  points_cost_range,
  COUNT(*) as prize_count,
  AVG(redemption_rate) as avg_redemption_rate,
  AVG(conversion_rate) as avg_conversion_rate
FROM (
  SELECT
    CASE
      WHEN points_cost <= 200 THEN 'Low (≤200)'
      WHEN points_cost <= 500 THEN 'Medium (201-500)'
      WHEN points_cost <= 1000 THEN 'High (501-1000)'
      ELSE 'Premium (>1000)'
    END as points_cost_range,
    points_cost,
    redemption_count::float / view_count as redemption_rate,
    wishlist_count::float / view_count as conversion_rate
  FROM prize_performance_stats
) sub
GROUP BY points_cost_range;
```

### **📊 User Behavior Optimization:**

```sql
-- User journey analysis
WITH user_journey AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN action = 'view_catalog' THEN created_at END) as first_view,
    MIN(CASE WHEN action = 'add_to_wishlist' THEN created_at END) as first_wishlist,
    MIN(CASE WHEN action = 'redeem_prize' THEN created_at END) as first_redemption
  FROM user_activity_log
  WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
  GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_users,
  COUNT(first_wishlist) as users_with_wishlist,
  COUNT(first_redemption) as users_with_redemption,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (first_wishlist - first_view))/3600) as hours_to_wishlist,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (first_redemption - first_view))/3600) as hours_to_redemption
FROM user_journey;
```
