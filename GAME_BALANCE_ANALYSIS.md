# ðŸŽ® **Bolobey Game Balance Analysis & Recommendations**

## ðŸ“Š **Current Economy Overview**

### **Dual-Point System**

- **Betting Points**: Purchased with real money, used for betting
- **Stream Points**: Earned through gameplay, used for prize redemption

### **Current Stream Points Sources**

1. **Betting Wins**: 50% of profit as stream points
2. **Tournament Participation**: Points for joining/winning tournaments
3. **Achievements**: Bonus stream points for milestones

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Issues & Analysis**

### **Issue 1: Stream Points Are Too Hard to Earn**

**Current Reality**:

- Users bet 10 points â†’ win 20 points (2x payout)
- Stream points awarded: 5 points (50% of 10-point profit)
- **Result**: Very slow stream points accumulation

**Example Scenario**:

- User bets 100 points â†’ wins 200 points
- Stream points earned: 50 points
- **To earn 500 points for a prize**: Need to win 10 bets of 100 points each

### **Issue 2: Betting Points vs Stream Points Imbalance**

- Betting points are purchased with real money
- Stream points are earned through skill/luck
- **Problem**: Stream points feel too scarce compared to betting points

---

## ðŸ’¡ **Proposed Solutions**

### **Solution 1: Increase Stream Points Rewards**

#### **Option A: Higher Percentage (Recommended)**

```sql
-- Change from 50% to 75% of profit
stream_points_to_award := FLOOR((bet_record.potential_winnings - bet_record.points_wagered) * 0.75);
```

**Impact**:

- 100-point bet â†’ 200-point win â†’ 75 stream points (vs current 50)
- **50% increase** in stream points earning rate

#### **Option B: Flat Rate Bonus**

```sql
-- Add flat bonus on top of percentage
stream_points_to_award := FLOOR((bet_record.potential_winnings - bet_record.points_wagered) * 0.5) + 10;
```

**Impact**:

- Every winning bet gets +10 stream points bonus
- Encourages more betting activity

### **Solution 2: Multiple Stream Points Sources**

#### **A. Daily Login Bonus**

```sql
-- Award 5-10 stream points for daily login
CREATE FUNCTION award_daily_login_bonus(user_uuid UUID)
RETURNS INTEGER AS $$
DECLARE
    bonus_amount INTEGER;
BEGIN
    -- Random bonus between 5-10 points
    bonus_amount := 5 + floor(random() * 6);

    -- Update user points
    UPDATE user_points
    SET stream_points = stream_points + bonus_amount,
        total_stream_points_earned = total_stream_points_earned + bonus_amount
    WHERE user_id = user_uuid;

    RETURN bonus_amount;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### **B. Tournament Participation Rewards**

```sql
-- Award stream points for tournament participation
-- 1st place: 100 stream points
-- 2nd place: 50 stream points
-- 3rd place: 25 stream points
-- Participation: 10 stream points
```

#### **C. Achievement System**

```sql
-- Milestone achievements with stream points rewards
-- "First Bet": 20 stream points
-- "Win Streak (3)": 50 stream points
-- "High Roller (100+ bet)": 30 stream points
-- "Tournament Champion": 200 stream points
```

### **Solution 3: Dynamic Odds System**

#### **A. Skill-Based Odds**

- Better players get higher odds
- Encourages skill development
- More stream points for skilled players

#### **B. Streak Bonuses**

- Consecutive wins increase stream points multiplier
- Win 3 in a row: +25% stream points
- Win 5 in a row: +50% stream points
