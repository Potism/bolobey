# Leaderboard Fix Test Guide

## ‚úÖ **Leaderboard Fixes Applied**

### **Problems Fixed:**

1. **Database View Issues**: The `player_stats` view was failing due to complex joins
2. **Fallback Logic**: No graceful degradation when views failed
3. **Data Calculation**: Missing manual calculation as last resort

### **Solutions Implemented:**

#### **1. Enhanced Database Views** ‚úÖ

- **Robust `player_stats` view**: Better error handling with COALESCE functions
- **Simple fallback view**: `simple_player_stats` for basic functionality
- **Proper permissions**: Granted SELECT access to both views

#### **2. Improved Leaderboard Page** ‚úÖ

- **Multi-level fallback**: Tries main view ‚Üí simple view ‚Üí manual calculation
- **Better error handling**: Detailed logging for debugging
- **Manual calculation**: Calculates stats from raw data if views fail

#### **3. Enhanced Data Sources** ‚úÖ

- **Tournament participants**: Uses `matches_played` and `matches_won` from `tournament_participants`
- **Tournament winners**: Tracks completed tournaments and winners
- **Point calculations**: Aggregates burst, ringout, and spinout points

## **Testing Steps:**

### **1. Basic Functionality**

- [ ] Navigate to `/leaderboard`
- [ ] Verify page loads without errors
- [ ] Check if real data is displayed (not demo data)

### **2. Data Verification**

- [ ] Check browser console for detailed logs
- [ ] Verify which data source is being used (view vs manual)
- [ ] Confirm player statistics are accurate

### **3. Features Testing**

- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Test sorting by different criteria
- [ ] Test refresh button
- [ ] Verify rank badges and icons

### **4. Error Scenarios**

- [ ] Test with no data (should show empty state)
- [ ] Test with partial data (should handle gracefully)
- [ ] Verify fallback to demo data if needed

## **Expected Results:**

### **‚úÖ Working Leaderboard Should Show:**

- Real player data from tournaments
- Accurate win percentages and statistics
- Proper ranking based on tournaments won
- Search and sort functionality
- Responsive design with proper styling

### **üîß If Issues Persist:**

- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify database connection
- Check if tournaments have been completed
- Ensure players have participated in matches

## **Database Views Created:**

1. **`player_stats`** - Main comprehensive view
2. **`simple_player_stats`** - Simplified fallback view
3. **Manual calculation** - Last resort data source

The leaderboard should now work reliably with multiple fallback mechanisms! üèÜ
